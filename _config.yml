# COLLECTION SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Wax leverages Jekyll collections for much of its
# functionality, therefor some of the keys below are from
# Jekyll while others are Wax-specific.
# For more info, refer to:
# ~> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/

collections:
  exhibits:
    output: true
  qatar: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: 'qatar_item' # the layout for the pages to use
    metadata:
      source: 'qatar.csv' # path to the metadata file within `_data`
    images:
      source: 'raw_images/qatar' # path to the directory of images within `_data`

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# SEARCH INDEX SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# You can create multiple search indexes below (though only one is
# recommended!) by specifying
# an `index` file to write it to and some `collections` for it to index
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:search` .

search:
  main:
    index: '/search/index.json' # file the index will get written to
    collections:
      qatar:
        content: false # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
          - artist
          - location
          - label
          - _date
          - object_type
          - current_location
