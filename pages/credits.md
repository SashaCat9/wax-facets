*Facets* is the team work of Angela Zoss and Alex Gil. During the lockdown, they met religiously for two hours every week. They still have not met in real life. 

*Facets* builds on the work of Marii Nyrop, and the cheerful encouragement of the Wax community which gathers on a channel on the Code4Lib Slack.
