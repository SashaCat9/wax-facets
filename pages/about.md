*Facets* is a theme for Wax sites that allows users to browse through a collection using facets, or filters. Often enough, when we are browsing through a collection of cultural artifacts we want to reduce the number of objects in front of us to a small collection that fits a very specific criteria. Faceted browsing is a form of browsing that allow you to do just that using filters you select. In *Facets* this can be achieved using drop-down menus where you can select the categories you want to browse by.

Besides the ability to do faceted browsing, *Facets* also allows creators to extract any subcollection that can be filtered by category and use it on any page of the site. We hope this will be useful in the creation of exhibits that focus on selections.

[Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) is a minimal computing toolkit for the creation of digital collections and exhibits. Wax depends on Jekyll, the static site generator.

## Credits 

*Facets* is the team work of Angela Zoss and Alex Gil. During the lockdown, they met religiously for two hours every week. They still have not met in real life. *Facets* builds on the work of Marii Nyrop, and the cheerful encouragement of the Wax community which gathers on a channel on the Code4Lib Slack.
